## DREAM Program
# NOTIONAL MACHINES

Welcome to my website! As a part of the [DREAM Research Program](https://tech.mines.edu/dream/), I'm spending this summer investigating Notional Machines.

### What is a Notional Machine?
If you've studied Computer Science even a little bit, it's more than likely that you've come across several already, as they are excellent educational tools, especially for beginner CS students.
A notional machine is a visual representation of program execution. In essence, a Notional Machine seeks to capture the general gist (or notion, if you will) of what a computer is doing while executing a program.
One fantastic and popular example comes from [Python Tutor](https://pythontutor.com/) 

### Why Study Them?
There are several reasons for continuing the work on Notional Machines. Although a site like PythonTutor functions well and has surely helped countless CS students, its visual design still has more potential. The way we choose to represent a part of a program has long-reaching consequences. For example, a variable might be displayed as a box which holds a value. Most students might assume that each box can hold only one value, which is correct, but some students might get the wrong impression that a variable can hold more than one value, simply because of the way that we chose to represent it visually.

The translation of a program into a notional machine is also of interest. There are many ways to obtain information about how a program is running. The simplest example is a stacktrace, which is typically printed out when a program hits an error. Efficient and targetted translation would help build educational tools and make notional machines for accessible to the beginner CS student.
