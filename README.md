### **Eric Roels**
I graduated with my Bachelor's in Astronomy-Physics from Colgate University in Spring 2021.
While there, I took several Computer Science courses and quickly fell in love with the subject.
I also honed my teaching skills as a Staff Member and Staff Trainer for the Outdoor Education program.
I'm now pursuing my Master's Degree here at the Colorado School of Mines while teaching Introductory Programming courses.

### **Professor Gabriel Fierro**
I am an assistant professor of Computer Science at Colorado School of Mines with a joint appointment at the National Renewable Energy Laboratory. I work at the intersection of databases, systems, information modeling, data science, the built environment and the Internet of Things. My research interests are broadly in designing, building and deploying systems that enable sustainable practices by making data easier to discover, manage and leverage. I am also interested in novel datasets or applications of data that motivate new data management techniques and abstractions.

I received my PhD in Computer Science from UC Berkeley in 2021, advised by Dr. David E. Culler. I was part of the Buildings, Energy and Transportation Systems project and the RISE lab. My dissertation title was Self-Adapting Software for Cyberphysical Systems.
